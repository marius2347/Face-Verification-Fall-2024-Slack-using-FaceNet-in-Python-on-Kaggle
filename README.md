# Face Verification Fall 2024 Slack using FaceNet in Python on Kaggle 

## Features
- Overview of face verification and the use of CNNs for position invariance
- Overview of face verification and the use of CNNs for position invariance
- Explanation of the goal to verify if two face images are of the same person
- Importing required libraries for data processing and model building (e.g., pandas, cv2, torch, facenet_pytorch)
- Loading validation and test data pairs for face image comparisons
- Visualizing similar and dissimilar face pairs to understand data distribution
- Loading the FaceNet (InceptionResnetV1) model for feature extraction
- Utilizing FaceNet to generate embeddings for face images, creating a vector representation
- Computing distances between face embeddings to determine similarity
- Setting a threshold to decide if two faces belong to the same person
- Using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to evaluate verification performance
- Applying the model on test pairs to check the model's generalization ability
- Accuracy: 0.90% on train data and on test data: 0.04756 EER (Equal Error Rate)
